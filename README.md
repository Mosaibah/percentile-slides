## Introduction

Ever wondered why your monitoring dashboards show "everything is fine" with averages, but users are still complaining about slow performance? This presentation reveals the hidden truth about why averages can be dangerously misleading and how percentiles provide the real story.

Through practical examples and real-world scenarios, you'll discover why leading tech companies rely on percentiles (P50, P90, P95, P99) instead of averages for performance monitoring and SLA definitions.

## ðŸŽ¯ What You'll Learn

- Why averages can be misleading in performance monitoring
- How percentiles provide better insights into user experience
- Real-world examples comparing averages vs percentiles
- Practical DevOps applications and SLO examples
